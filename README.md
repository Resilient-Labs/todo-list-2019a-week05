# Cute "To-do" List

A simple to-do list that displays whatever is inputted and can be individually removed or clear all.

### How its made:

**languages used:** HTML5, CSS3, Javascript and jquery

First formulated my HTML and layout to be javascript friendly, added IDs and setup my form for the button and input elements. Then I built out my js program. Mostly used jquery for the event listeners on both buttons and removing list items one by one. Fixed edge-cases like the counter not resetting items are erased and making empty list items.

## Lessons Learned:

Learned how to append new content into the DOM and remove them one by one, about edge-cases, how to prevent the counter from miscounting and getting the input value to not send any empty strings.
