## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS and JQuery


I built this project by creating an HTML document in order to create the header, input form, button elements and the list. Then I created the JavaScript file that will target the elements in my HTML document and give each element a function. After I completed both the HTML and JQuery I created a CSS file in order to style my site background color and font styles.


## Lessons Learned:

Here I learned how to use the append method on JQuery.
