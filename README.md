## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Jquery

This was a fairly, though not extremely, simple project. I used a simple click event listener and took the input into a variable before using append to  add the variable and a new li tag to the HTML. Another on-click event was used to remove created list items and then a simple variable (using .length) to keep a count of the number of list items.

## Optimizations
There are a few things I'd like to add on. Instead of clicking the whole list item to remove it, I want to add in a span with the created list items that can be clicked to remove. I'd also like there to be a way to see and undo selection of list items to delete (either by striking them through on 1 click and having another button for removal + double click removal option or having another visible list for recently deleted items).

## Lessons Learned:

This was my first time using a variable in the HTML through Jquery as well as the this function.

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
