# To Do List
This was a simple project made to make a list of any kind, able to add and delete.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, JavaScript

I started with some simple html, created the buttons and the space to hold the list. Then moved into javascript to make it so when the user the types the info the buttons store the value into a array. That value is also displayed for the user.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned that JavaScript can create new syntax on the html.
